# Accepting Payments in Indonesia: Stripe, Manual Transfer, and the Dual Checkout Pattern

Indonesia is WhatsApp's second-largest market. If you're building a SaaS platform for Indonesian businesses, you'll quickly discover a truth that Silicon Valley ignores: not everyone pays by credit card.

At Gigaviz, we solved this with what we call the **dual checkout pattern** — two payment methods in one interface, each optimized for its audience.

## The Indonesian payment reality

Indonesia has over 270 million people, but credit card penetration is under 5%. Most B2B transactions happen via bank transfer (BCA, Mandiri, BRI, BNI). Mobile wallets like GoPay, OVO, and Dana are growing fast but aren't standard for SaaS subscriptions yet.

Meanwhile, international customers expect Stripe. They want to enter a card number, click pay, and be done.

You can't choose one over the other. You need both.

## The dual checkout pattern

Every token package in Gigaviz shows two payment buttons:

**Pay with Card** — Opens Stripe Checkout. Credit card, debit card, or any Stripe-supported method. Tokens are credited automatically when payment completes.

**Manual / Transfer** — Creates a pending top-up request. Customer transfers via bank, then marks the payment as completed. Admin verifies and activates the tokens.

Both flows end at the same place: tokens in the workspace wallet, transaction in the ledger, audit trail complete.

## How we built the Stripe integration

### Server-side session creation

When a user clicks "Pay with Card", the client sends a request to our checkout endpoint. The server:

1. Validates the request (workspace ID, token amount, price)
2. Creates a Stripe Checkout Session with the correct line items
3. Records a payment record in our database (status: pending)
4. Returns the Stripe Checkout URL

The client then redirects to Stripe's hosted checkout page. We never handle raw card data.

### Webhook processing

When payment completes, Stripe sends a `checkout.session.completed` webhook to our webhook handler. We:

1. Verify the webhook signature (reject tampering)
2. Look up the payment record by Stripe session ID
3. Credit tokens to the workspace wallet
4. Update the payment status to "completed"
5. Record the transaction in the token ledger

This happens asynchronously — even if the user closes their browser after paying, the webhook ensures tokens are credited.

### Feature flag

Stripe payments are controlled by a single feature flag. This lets us:

- Enable card payments per environment (dev, staging, production)
- Disable card payments instantly if there's a Stripe incident
- Roll out card payments gradually to specific regions

When disabled, only the manual transfer button appears. Zero UI changes needed.

## How the manual transfer flow works

For businesses that prefer bank transfers:

1. Customer selects a token package and clicks "Manual / Transfer"
2. System creates a pending top-up request in the database
3. Customer transfers the exact amount to our bank account
4. Customer clicks "Mark paid" on the billing page
5. Admin sees the pending request in the ops console
6. Admin verifies the bank transfer and activates the tokens

This is deliberately manual for now. Automating bank transfer verification requires integration with Indonesian payment gateways like Xendit or Midtrans — which is on our roadmap.

## Why not just use Xendit or Midtrans?

We will. But Stripe-first made sense for several reasons:

**Stripe is global.** Our first paying customers include agencies in Singapore and Malaysia. Stripe works in 46+ countries. Starting with Stripe means we can accept payments from Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe immediately.

**Stripe's developer experience is unmatched.** The SDK, documentation, and webhook system are best-in-class. We integrated Stripe in under a day.

**Xendit adds Indonesian coverage.** When we add Xendit (planned Q2 2026), it'll handle virtual accounts, e-wallets (GoPay, OVO, Dana), QRIS, and convenience store payments. This covers the 95% of Indonesians without credit cards.

**The dual pattern scales.** Adding Xendit just means adding a third button: "Pay with Local Methods". The architecture already supports multiple payment providers — each one creates a payment intent, processes asynchronously via webhooks, and credits tokens to the same wallet.

## Token-based pricing: why it works for messaging SaaS

We don't charge per seat or per message. We use a token economy:

- Each action costs tokens (messaging, AI responses, content generation — each with its own token rate)
- Workspaces buy token packages (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Usage is tracked in real-time with daily breakdown charts
- Budget guards prevent overspending (configurable monthly caps, hard caps, alert thresholds)

This model works because messaging volume is unpredictable. A marketing campaign might send 10,000 messages in a day, then nothing for a week. Per-seat pricing penalizes small teams with high volume. Per-message pricing penalizes everyone. Tokens let customers buy capacity and use it however they need.

## Lessons for SaaS builders in Southeast Asia

**Don't gate-keep on payment methods.** If your only checkout option is Stripe, you're invisible to 95% of Indonesian businesses. Offer bank transfer from day one.

**Make manual transfers first-class.** Don't hide the bank transfer option behind a "contact sales" button. Show it next to the card payment button. Make it self-service.

**Track everything in one ledger.** Whether payment comes from Stripe, bank transfer, or a future Xendit integration, it should all end up in the same token ledger with the same audit trail.

**Feature-flag your payment providers.** Payment systems break. Stripe has outages. Bank APIs go down. Being able to disable a payment method with one environment variable is worth the engineering investment.

**Start with manual, automate later.** Our manual transfer flow works today. Xendit automation comes later. Don't let "we need automated payments" block you from accepting money.

## What's next

Our payment roadmap:

- **Xendit integration** for virtual accounts, e-wallets, and QRIS (Q2 2026)
- **Recurring subscriptions** via Stripe for plan-based billing
- **Invoice generation** with Indonesian tax compliance (Faktur Pajak)
- **Multi-currency support** — IDR, USD, SGD, MYR pricing

The dual checkout pattern is our foundation. Every new payment provider plugs into the same architecture: create intent, process webhook, credit tokens, log transaction.
