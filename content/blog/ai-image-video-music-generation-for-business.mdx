# AI Image, Video & Music Generation for Business Teams — Inside Gigaviz Studio

Creating marketing content has always required too many tools. You need Canva for graphics, a video editor for clips, a stock library for music, and then you manually upload everything to your CRM, WhatsApp campaigns, or social channels. Each tool is another login, another subscription, another context switch.

Today we're eliminating that fragmentation with **AI Media Generation** inside Gigaviz Studio — three new modules that let your team create images, videos, and music without leaving the platform.

## What you can create

### 🎨 AI Images — 10 Style Presets

Create any visual asset your business needs:

| Style | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **Photo-realistic** | Product mockups, hero banners, social media posts |
| **Illustration** | Blog headers, infographics, educational content |
| **3D Render** | Product showcases, tech demos, presentations |
| **Watercolor** | Wedding/event businesses, artisan brands |
| **Pixel Art** | Gaming, retro brands, fun social content |
| **Abstract** | Backgrounds, decorative elements, brand textures |
| **Flat Design** | App screenshots, UI mockups, clean marketing |
| **Anime** | Entertainment, youth brands, creative campaigns |
| **Logo** | Brand identity, watermarks, app icons |
| **Icon** | UI elements, feature highlights, category markers |

Each image supports **PNG, JPG, WebP, or SVG** output formats. Add tags for organization and an AI prompt describing exactly what you want.

### 🎬 AI Videos — 8 Production Styles

Create professional video content at scale:

- **Marketing** — Brand awareness clips, ad creatives, promotional content
- **Explainer** — How-it-works videos, onboarding guides, feature walkthroughs
- **Product Demo** — Showcase your product features with polished visuals
- **Social Reel** — Short-form content optimized for Instagram, TikTok, and WhatsApp Stories
- **Animation** — Animated graphics, logo reveals, motion design
- **Cinematic** — High-production-value brand films and testimonials
- **Tutorial** — Step-by-step educational content
- **Testimonial** — Customer story videos with professional framing

Choose between **720p, 1080p, or 4K** resolution. Set custom durations from **5 seconds to 5 minutes**. Export as MP4, WebM, or MOV.

### 🎵 AI Music — 12 Genre Options

Create original audio for your content:

- **Pop, Rock, Electronic, Jazz, Classical, Hip-Hop** — Background music for videos
- **Ambient, Lo-Fi** — Focus music for content, hold music for calls
- **Cinematic** — Film-quality scores for brand videos
- **Jingle** — Catchy brand tunes for ads and campaigns
- **Podcast Intro** — Professional opener music for your company podcast
- **Sound Effect** — UI sounds, notification tones, transition effects

Set **BPM (40–300)**, **key signature**, and **duration** for precise control. Export as MP3, WAV, OGG, or FLAC.

## Why this matters for business teams

### 1. Zero context switching

Your marketing team already manages WhatsApp campaigns in Meta Hub, tracks leads in Helper AI, and builds reports in Office. Now they can generate the visuals, videos, and audio for those campaigns in the same workspace.

### 2. Campaign-ready assets

Every piece of media you create lives in your workspace alongside your contacts, templates, and workflows. Need a product image for a WhatsApp broadcast template? Create it in Graph, attach it in Meta Hub. No downloading, no uploading, no file management headaches.

### 3. Brand consistency

With tagged assets, shared workspaces, and AI prompts you can reuse, your team produces on-brand content every time. No more rogue Canva designs with the wrong colors.

### 4. Cost reduction

Instead of paying for separate subscriptions to Midjourney ($30/mo), Runway ($15/mo), and Epidemic Sound ($15/mo), your Gigaviz plan includes all three capabilities. For teams of 5+, the savings add up fast.

## How it works

1. **Navigate to Studio** → Choose Graph (for images/videos) or Tracks (for music)
2. **Select a style or genre** from the visual grid
3. **Write an AI prompt** describing what you want
4. **Configure settings** — format, resolution, duration, BPM
5. **Create** — your media appears in your library once generated
6. **Use it** — attach to WhatsApp templates, embed in documents, or share with your team

Every asset is scoped to your workspace with enterprise-grade security (RLS policies, workspace isolation, encrypted storage).

## Technical details for the curious

Built on the same architecture as the rest of Gigaviz:

- **Next.js 16** server components for fast initial loads
- **Supabase** with Row Level Security for workspace isolation
- **Zod validation** on every API endpoint
- **Entitlement gating** — AI media requires Growth plan or above
- **i18n** — Full English and Indonesian language support
- **Loading skeletons** and **error boundaries** for every page

Three new database tables, six API endpoints, nine pages, three action components — all following our established patterns for consistency and maintainability.

## What's coming next

- **AI generation backends** — connecting to state-of-the-art models for each media type
- **Batch generation** — create 10 variations of an image with one prompt
- **Template-based creation** — generate media from pre-built templates
- **Meta Hub integration** — attach AI-generated assets directly to WhatsApp campaigns
- **Media library** — search, filter, and manage all your generated assets in one place

## Get started

AI Media Generation is available now for all workspaces on the **Growth plan** and above.

1. Log in to your Gigaviz workspace
2. Navigate to **Studio** from the sidebar
3. Open **Graph → AI Images**, **Graph → AI Videos**, or **Tracks → AI Music**
