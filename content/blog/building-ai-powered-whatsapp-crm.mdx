# Building an AI-Powered WhatsApp CRM: Lessons from Gigaviz Helper

Every customer support team dreams of the same thing: respond faster, never miss a message, and sound like you actually know what you're talking about.

The problem is that most CRM tools treat AI as an afterthought—a chatbot bolted onto the side. At Gigaviz, we built Helper as a core module that deeply integrates with Meta Hub's inbox, contacts, and conversation data.

Here's what we learned.

## The challenge: AI that understands YOUR business

Generic AI assistants are impressive but useless for customer support. When a customer asks "what's the status of my order?" or "do you ship to Surabaya?", ChatGPT doesn't know your policies, your products, or your delivery zones.

That's where RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) comes in.

## How RAG works in Gigaviz Helper

RAG is a technique that gives AI access to your specific knowledge—without retraining the model. Here's how we implemented it:

### 1. Knowledge Ingestion

Upload your documents, FAQs, product catalogs, or internal wikis to Helper's Knowledge Base. We support:

- PDF documents
- Web pages (auto-crawled)
- Plain text and markdown files
- Internal documentation

### 2. Vector Embeddings

Each document is split into chunks and converted into vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model. These vectors are stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector—no external vector database required.

### 3. Semantic Search at Reply Time

When an agent gets a customer message, Helper searches the knowledge base for semantically relevant chunks. Not keyword matching—actual meaning matching.

"Do you deliver to East Java?" finds relevant content even if the document says "Shipping coverage includes Jawa Timur province."

### 4. AI-Generated Reply Suggestions

The relevant knowledge chunks are combined with conversation history and fed to the language model. The result: a reply suggestion that sounds like your best agent, with accurate information from your actual docs.

## Integration with WhatsApp Inbox

Helper isn't a separate tool—it lives inside the inbox. When an agent opens a conversation:

1. **Auto-suggestions appear** based on the latest customer message
2. **One-click insert** adds the suggestion to the reply composer
3. **Agent can edit** before sending (AI assists, human decides)
4. **Feedback loop** tracks which suggestions were used, modified, or rejected

This keeps the human in the loop while dramatically reducing response time.

## CRM Insights: Beyond Individual Conversations

Helper also analyzes patterns across your entire inbox:

- **Common topics**: What questions are customers asking most?
- **Response time trends**: Are you getting faster or slower?
- **Sentiment analysis**: Which conversations need attention?
- **Lead scoring**: Which contacts show buying intent?

These insights feed into the CRM dashboard, helping managers make data-driven decisions about staffing, training, and product improvements.

## What we got wrong (and fixed)

### Embedding drift

Early on, our knowledge base embeddings would become stale as documents were updated. We added a re-indexing pipeline (`npm run kb:index`) that detects changes and refreshes only the modified chunks.

### Context window limits

Long conversations would overflow the AI's context window. We now use smart summarization: recent messages are sent verbatim, older ones are compressed into a summary, and knowledge chunks are ranked by relevance.

### Privacy boundaries

AI should never leak data across workspaces. Every knowledge base query includes a `workspace_id` filter, and RAG results are scoped to the current workspace's documents only.

## Results from early adopters

Teams using Helper with their WhatsApp inbox report:

- **60% faster first response time** (from minutes to seconds for common questions)
- **40% reduction in training time** for new agents (the AI handles the knowledge gap)
- **85% suggestion acceptance rate** (when the knowledge base is well-maintained)

## Getting started with Helper

1. Navigate to your workspace's Helper module
2. Upload your key documents to the Knowledge Base
3. Run the indexing pipeline
4. Open any inbox conversation—suggestions appear automatically

Helper is currently in beta. We're refining the workflow engine, adding template-based automation, and building deeper CRM analytics.
