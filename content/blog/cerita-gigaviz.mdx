## Why Gigaviz Was Built

It all started with one simple question: how can small teams move fast without losing control? As work increased, disconnected tools actually slowed down execution. From there, we chose to build one clean, interconnected workflow.

Gigaviz was built by Giusty Adhyarachmat Eryan (Giusty) with the goal of unifying Create, Automate, Monetize, and Manage in one easy-to-use ecosystem. This journey is operated by PT Gigaviz Digital Indonesia.

## When Everything Became a System

As modules began to connect one by one, we realized this wasn't just a collection of tools. This was a system. Create -> Automate -> Monetize -> Manage became the compass that kept focus, ensuring each module complements the others—from content production to billing and audit.

## Key Milestones

- Early experiments from internal needs.
- First module helped communication and operations.
- Integrated platform with identity and billing.
- PT Gigaviz Digital Indonesia established as the operational foundation.
- Ecosystem v1.1 launched to expand reach.

## Moving Forward

We will continue strengthening the ecosystem so teams can work faster, clearer, and more measurably. If you want to follow this journey, explore Gigaviz products and start from your needs.
