# Gigaviz Studio Complete Guide: AI Documents, Charts, Images & More in One Creative Suite

Creating business content shouldn't require six different tools, three browser tabs, and a graphic designer on speed-dial. That's why we built **Gigaviz Studio** — a unified creative suite where you describe what you need, and AI builds it for you. Documents, charts, images, dashboards — all generated from a single prompt, all inside your workspace.

This guide covers everything Studio can do today, how the token economy works, and what's coming next.

## What is Gigaviz Studio?

Gigaviz Studio is an AI-powered creative suite built into the Gigaviz SaaS platform. It has three modules:

- **Office** — AI document automation (reports, invoices, proposals)
- **Graph** — Data visualization (charts, dashboards, AI images, video storyboards)
- **Tracks** — Workflow automation and AI music composition

Each module is gated by workspace entitlements, so you only pay for what you use. Every generation consumes tokens from your workspace balance — no surprise bills, no per-API-call pricing.

## The 6 content types you can generate

### 1. AI Document Generation (Office)

**What it does**: Describe what you need — "Create a Q4 sales report for the Southeast Asia market" — and Studio generates a structured document with title, sections, headings, body text, and an executive summary.

**AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini  
**Token Cost**: 20 tokens per generation  
**Output**: Structured JSON document with title, multiple sections (heading + body), and a summary paragraph.

**Use cases**:
- Monthly client reports from CRM data
- Sales proposals with product descriptions
- Internal memos and meeting summaries
- Invoice drafts with line items

The document is stored as structured JSON, which means you can edit individual sections, re-order them, or regenerate specific parts without starting over.

### 2. AI Image Generation (Graph)

**What it does**: Type a prompt like "Modern tech startup logo with gradient blue and purple colors" and Studio generates a real image using DALL-E 3.

**AI Model**: DALL-E 3  
**Token Cost**: 40 tokens per generation  
**Output**: High-quality image saved to your workspace storage (persisted permanently — not a temporary URL).

**10 style presets**:
- Photo Realistic, Illustration, 3D Render, Watercolor
- Pixel Art, Abstract, Flat Design, Anime
- Logo, Icon

The style preset modifies the prompt sent to DALL-E 3, so "Logo" prepends instructions for clean vector-style output while "Photo Realistic" emphasizes photographic quality.

**Why we persist to Supabase Storage**: DALL-E 3 returns temporary URLs that expire. We download the generated image and re-upload it to your workspace's Supabase Storage bucket, so it's available forever.

### 3. AI Chart Generation (Graph)

**What it does**: Describe your data — "Monthly revenue chart for 2025 showing growth trend" — and Studio generates a complete chart configuration with sample data, labels, and visual settings.

**AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini  
**Token Cost**: 40 tokens per generation  
**Output**: Chart type recommendation + labels + datasets + configuration, rendered live by our ChartRenderer component.

**Supported chart types**:
- Bar, Line, Pie, Area, Scatter, Radar
- Funnel (for conversion analysis)
- Heatmap (for correlation matrices)

Charts are rendered using Recharts with a custom dark theme. You can export any chart as **PNG (2x retina)** or **SVG** using the built-in export button.

### 4. AI Dashboard Generation (Graph)

**What it does**: Describe a dashboard — "Executive KPI dashboard for e-commerce store" — and Studio generates a responsive widget layout with stat cards, chart widgets, text blocks, and data tables.

**AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini  
**Token Cost**: 40 tokens per generation  
**Output**: Widget grid JSON rendered by the DashboardRenderer component.

**Widget types**:
- Stat cards (metric + label + trend indicator)
- Chart widgets (embedded chart configurations)
- Text blocks (markdown-compatible)
- Data tables (headers + rows)

Dashboards can be toggled between **public** and **private**. Public dashboards are shareable with stakeholders via URL — no login required.

### 5. AI Video Storyboard (Graph)

**What it does**: Describe a video concept — "60-second product demo for our WhatsApp CRM tool" — and Studio generates a storyboard with scene descriptions, narration script, and music suggestions.

**AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini  
**Token Cost**: 40 tokens per generation  
**Output**: Scene-by-scene breakdown with visual descriptions, timing, narration text, and a music/SFX recommendation.

**8 video styles**: Marketing, Explainer, Product Demo, Social Reel, Animation, Cinematic, Tutorial, Testimonial.

> **Note**: This generates a storyboard and script — not an actual video file. Video rendering via AI providers like Runway ML or Pika is on our roadmap.

### 6. AI Music Composition (Tracks)

**What it does**: Describe what you hear — "Upbeat electronic jingle for a tech product launch, 120 BPM, key of G" — and Studio generates a composition plan with structure, mood analysis, instrument suggestions, and a waveform visualization.

**AI Model**: GPT-4o-mini  
**Token Cost**: 30 tokens per generation  
**Output**: Composition metadata with structure (intro/verse/chorus/bridge/outro), mood tags, instrument list, and waveform visualization data.

**12 genres**: Pop, Rock, Electronic, Ambient, Jazz, Classical, Hip-Hop, Lo-Fi, Cinematic, Jingle, Podcast Intro, Sound Effect.

> **Note**: This generates a composition plan — not an actual audio file. Audio synthesis via providers like Suno or ElevenLabs is on our roadmap.

## How the token economy works

Every workspace has a token balance. AI generations consume tokens at fixed rates:

| Content Type | Token Cost | AI Model |
|---|---|---|
| Document | 20 tokens | GPT-4o-mini |
| Image | 40 tokens | DALL-E 3 |
| Chart | 40 tokens | GPT-4o-mini |
| Dashboard | 40 tokens | GPT-4o-mini |
| Video storyboard | 40 tokens | GPT-4o-mini |
| Music composition | 30 tokens | GPT-4o-mini |

**Token deduction is atomic**: We use a database operation with row-level locking. If two team members generate content simultaneously, the system prevents overdraft — one succeeds, the other gets a clear "insufficient tokens" error (HTTP 402).

**Why fixed token costs instead of per-API-call billing?** Predictability. Your team knows exactly how many documents, images, or dashboards they can create this month. No surprises when the bill arrives.

## The generation flow

Every content type follows the same 5-step pipeline:

1. **Create** — User fills in a title, selects a type/style/genre, and optionally writes a prompt
2. **Validate** — Zod schema validates all input fields (type-safe at the API boundary)
3. **Authorize** — Check workspace membership, role, and feature entitlement
4. **Deduct tokens** — Atomic token consumption before any AI call
5. **Generate** — Call OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini or DALL-E 3), persist results, update entity status

If you provide a prompt during creation, generation starts automatically in the background — you see the detail page immediately, and results appear when ready.

If you skip the prompt, you can trigger generation later using the **Generate with AI** button on any detail page.

## Reusable components

Studio ships with reusable components that make the generated content interactive:

- **Chart Renderer** — Renders 8 chart types (bar, line, pie, area, scatter, radar, funnel, heatmap) with dark theme and custom tooltips
- **Chart Export** — Export any rendered chart as PNG (2x retina) or SVG
- **Dashboard Renderer** — Responsive grid layout for stat/chart/text/table widgets
- **Waveform Visualizer** — Canvas-based audio waveform with play/pause animation
- **Video Storyboard** — Timeline visualization for scene-by-scene storyboards
- **AI Generate Button** — Reusable AI trigger with loading state, error handling, and token gating
- **Universal Actions** — CRUD actions (edit, delete, confirm) for all entity types

## Entitlement gating

Not every workspace has access to every module. Studio uses a layered entitlement system:

- **Plan-based**: Free plans get limited access; paid plans unlock more modules
- **Owner grants**: Platform admins can manually unlock modules for specific workspaces
- **Feature keys**: `office`, `graph`, `tracks`, and `studio` (the parent key)

If a workspace doesn't have the required entitlement, they see a locked state with an upgrade prompt — no broken pages, no mysterious errors.

## Internationalization

Every Studio page, component, and error message is fully translated in **English** and **Indonesian** (Bahasa Indonesia). This includes:

- Sidebar navigation with collapsible sections
- All 6 content type labels, descriptions, and form fields
- Style/genre/format enum labels (10 image styles, 8 video styles, 12 music genres)
- Generation status messages and error states
- Token balance warnings and 402 error messages

## What's on the roadmap
