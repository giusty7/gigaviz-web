Giusty Adhyarachmat Eryan (Giusty) is the founder of Gigaviz, a digital product ecosystem designed to help teams move fast without losing control. This profile covers why Gigaviz was built, the product principles it upholds, and the development direction of the ecosystem under PT Gigaviz Digital Indonesia.

## Founder Overview

Giusty built Gigaviz from a practical need commonly encountered in the field: when tools are too disconnected, teams struggle to move in sync. His approach is simple yet deliberate: products should simplify workflows, not add coordination overhead. That's why Gigaviz was born with a focus on integrated identity, workspace, and billing so teams can focus on outcomes.

At Gigaviz, the founder's role isn't just to set vision—it's to maintain consistency in user experience quality. The focus is on designing an ecosystem that's easy to use, secure, and ready to scale. For the full story, see [About Gigaviz](/about).

## Why Gigaviz Was Built

Many small teams start with a stack of quick-to-adopt tools. But as the business grows, these tools scatter information, slow down coordination, and weaken accountability. Gigaviz was built to unify these work systems: one account, one workspace, and one interconnected dashboard.

Another reason is the need for visibility. Without audit logs, access control, and clear billing, operations easily sprawl. Gigaviz provides a clean foundation so teams can accelerate execution while maintaining security and control.

## Product Principles: Create -> Automate -> Monetize -> Manage

Gigaviz uses Create -> Automate -> Monetize -> Manage as its product compass. This isn't a slogan—it's a framework to ensure every module reinforces the others.

Create focuses on producing consistent content, templates, and assets. Automate speeds up routine work so team energy can shift to strategic tasks. Monetize ensures revenue can be managed cleanly through billing and transactions. Manage ensures all processes stay controlled through roles, audit trails, and dashboards.

With these principles, the ecosystem isn't built randomly. Every module is evaluated: does it help teams create output faster, does it reduce operational friction, does it support monetization, and does it stay secure as scale increases.

## Legal & Operations

Gigaviz is operated by PT Gigaviz Digital Indonesia. This legal structure ensures development and collaboration are conducted formally and professionally, whether with partners, clients, or the community. Operationally, the team maintains consistency in policies, documentation, and basic compliance so the ecosystem can grow in an orderly manner.

## What's Being Built

The Gigaviz ecosystem is built in stages with several core modules. In the Core OS layer, Gigaviz Platform provides accounts, workspaces, billing, and audit as the foundation for every module. On the communications side, Gigaviz Meta Hub manages WhatsApp Cloud API integration, templates, webhooks, inbox, and scheduler.

For productivity, Gigaviz Helper assists with copy creation, summaries, and quick ideas, while Gigaviz Office provides work templates, formula assistants, and document generators. For creative needs, Gigaviz Studio offers asset library, prompt library, and versioning. Within Studio, Graph and Tracks appear as submodules for visual galleries and music asset management.

In the growth layer, Gigaviz Marketplace and Arena are prepared for digital asset monetization and experience-based engagement. Gigaviz Apps enables app requests and structured ticketing, while Gigaviz Pay is prepared for invoices and payment links. Gigaviz Community closes the ecosystem with a space for healthy interaction and collaboration. To see all modules, visit [Gigaviz Products](/products).
