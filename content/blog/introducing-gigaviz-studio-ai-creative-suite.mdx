# Introducing Gigaviz Studio: An AI-Powered Creative Suite for Business Teams

Most business teams juggle half a dozen apps to get work done: one for documents, another for charts, a third for automation, and a fourth to glue them all together. That fragmentation kills focus, breaks context, and wastes time.

Today we're launching **Gigaviz Studio** — a creative suite built directly into the Gigaviz platform. Three specialized modules, one workspace, zero context-switching.

## The three modules

### 🏢 Office — AI Document Automation

Office turns your data into production-ready documents. Upload a spreadsheet, connect a template, and let AI fill in the rest.

- **Supported formats**: Excel (`.xlsx`), Word (`.docx`), PDF export
- **AI-powered**: Auto-generate reports, invoices, and proposals from your CRM data
- **Template library**: Start from pre-built templates or create your own
- **Create & manage**: Full document lifecycle — create, view details, track status

Whether you're generating monthly reports for 50 clients or drafting proposals from contact records, Office handles the heavy lifting.

### 📊 Graph — Data Visualization

Graph helps you turn raw numbers into clear, shareable visuals.

- **Chart types**: Bar, line, pie, area, scatter, and more
- **Dashboard builder**: Compose multiple charts into interactive dashboards (coming soon)
- **Live data**: Charts pull from your workspace data — always up to date
- **Share & embed**: Public dashboards for stakeholders, embeddable charts for external sites

No more exporting CSVs to another tool just to make a chart. Your data stays in Gigaviz, and your charts stay current.

### 🎵 Tracks — Workflow Automation

Tracks automates the repetitive work that drains your team.

- **Visual workflow builder**: Define triggers, conditions, and actions (coming soon)
- **Execution monitoring**: Track every run with status, duration, and error details
- **Pre-built templates**: Common automations ready to deploy
- **Integration-ready**: Connect with Meta Hub for WhatsApp-triggered workflows

Send a follow-up message when a lead goes cold. Generate a report when a deal closes. Tracks handles the plumbing so your team can focus on strategy.

## Architecture decisions we're proud of

### Server-first, always

Studio follows the same server-first architecture as the rest of Gigaviz. Every page is a React Server Component by default. Client-side JavaScript is used only where interaction demands it (forms, modals, drag-and-drop).

This means Studio pages load fast, even on slow connections.

### Entitlement-gated access

Each module has its own entitlement key. Access is checked both at the page level (Server Component) and the API level (middleware). If your plan doesn't include a module, you see a clear upgrade prompt — not a broken page.

### RLS-scoped queries

Every database query is filtered by `workspace_id` and uses RLS-respecting Supabase clients. Studio inherits the same multi-tenant security model that protects Meta Hub and Helper data.

### Proper error boundaries

Every Studio sub-route has dedicated `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` files. If something goes wrong, users see a clear error message with a retry button — not a white screen.
