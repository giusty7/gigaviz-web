# Manage WhatsApp Status, Instagram & Facebook Content from One Dashboard

If you run a business on social media, your mornings probably look like this: open WhatsApp to post a Status update, switch to Instagram to upload a Reel, jump to Facebook to schedule a Page post, then check three separate analytics dashboards to see what worked.

That's three apps, three logins, three content workflows — before your first coffee.

Today we're shipping the **Content Publishing module** inside Gigaviz Meta Hub. One dashboard to create, schedule, and publish content across WhatsApp Status, Instagram, and Facebook. No more tab-switching. No more copy-pasting captions between apps.

## Why businesses need unified content publishing

### The multi-channel reality

Modern businesses don't live on one platform. A typical Indonesian UMKM (small-to-medium business) might:

- Post 2–3 **WhatsApp Status** updates per day to showcase products
- Share 1–2 **Instagram posts** or Stories with promotional content
- Publish **Facebook Page** posts for broader reach and SEO

Each platform has its own content format, its own scheduling tools, and its own analytics. Managing them separately is time-consuming and error-prone. A promotion goes live on Instagram but gets forgotten on WhatsApp. A product photo gets uploaded to Facebook but with the wrong caption.

### The Gigaviz approach: one hub, three channels

The Content Publishing module brings all three channels into a single interface inside your Gigaviz workspace:

- **See everything at once** — a unified dashboard shows your recent content across all channels
- **Create from one place** — compose content with the right format for each platform
- **Schedule ahead** — plan your content calendar and publish at the right time
- **Track performance** — see which content drives the most engagement across platforms

## What you can do today

### WhatsApp Status Publishing

WhatsApp Status is one of the most underutilized marketing tools for businesses. With over 100 million users in Indonesia alone, Status updates reach your contacts directly — no algorithm filtering, no pay-to-play.

With Gigaviz, you can:

- **Create text and image Status updates** with rich formatting
- **Preview your Status** before publishing — see exactly how it appears to your contacts
- **Add links** to drive traffic to your website, catalog, or bio page
- **Track views** to understand which content resonates

**Pro tip**: Post Status updates during peak hours (7–9 AM and 7–9 PM in Indonesia) for maximum visibility. WhatsApp Status disappears after 24 hours, so timing matters.

### Instagram Content Management

Instagram is where your brand's visual identity lives. The Content Publishing module helps you maintain a consistent presence:

- **Manage posts, Stories, and Reels** from your workspace
- **Write captions** with hashtag suggestions and emoji support
- **Upload media** with format optimization for each content type
- **Schedule publication** to maintain consistent posting frequency

Whether you're sharing behind-the-scenes photos, product launches, or customer testimonials, everything stays organized in one timeline.

### Facebook Page Publishing

Facebook remains essential for businesses targeting older demographics and for SEO benefits. With Content Publishing, you can:

- **Create Page posts** with text, images, links, and call-to-action buttons
- **Add rich media** — carousels, videos, and link previews
- **Schedule posts** for optimal engagement times
- **Publish immediately** when time-sensitive content needs to go live now

## How Content Publishing fits into Meta Hub

Content Publishing is the newest addition to Gigaviz Meta Hub — our unified Meta Business Platform integration. Here's how it connects with your existing tools:

### The five sections of Meta Hub

We've reorganized Meta Hub's navigation into five clear sections:

1. **Setup** — Connect your WhatsApp Business accounts, configure webhooks, and manage API connections
2. **Messaging** — Send templates, compose messages, schedule broadcasts, and manage your unified inbox
3. **Content** — The new Content Hub, WhatsApp Status, Instagram, and Facebook modules
4. **Growth** — Contact management, automation rules, and conversation flows
5. **Analytics** — Delivery reports and performance dashboards

Content Publishing lives in the **Content** section, right next to your messaging tools. This means you can go from publishing a Status update to responding to customer messages without leaving Meta Hub.

### Connected workflows

The real power comes from connecting content with your other Meta Hub tools:

- **Publish a WhatsApp Status** promoting a new product → customers reply to your Status → the reply lands in your **unified inbox** → your team responds and closes the sale
- **Post on Instagram** about a promotion → include a link to your **Gigaviz Links** bio page → track clicks and WhatsApp inquiries from that specific post
- **Schedule a Facebook post** with a "Chat on WhatsApp" button → new conversations appear in your inbox with full context

This is what "all-in-one" actually means — not just features in the same app, but features that work together.

## Best practices for multi-channel content

### 1. Don't copy-paste the same content everywhere

Each platform has its own audience expectations:

| Platform | Best content type | Tone | Ideal length |
|----------|------------------|------|-------------|
| WhatsApp Status | Product photos, daily offers, behind-the-scenes | Personal, casual | Short (1–2 sentences + image) |
| Instagram | Polished visuals, Reels, carousels | Aspirational, branded | Medium (caption + hashtags) |
| Facebook | Articles, promotions, community updates | Informative, conversational | Longer (2–3 paragraphs OK) |

### 2. Maintain a content calendar

Consistency beats perfection. A simple schedule works:

- **Morning**: WhatsApp Status (daily offers, greetings)
- **Midday**: Instagram post or Story (product spotlight)
- **Afternoon**: Facebook post (article, promotion, or community update)

### 3. Use each platform's strengths

- **WhatsApp Status**: Urgency and exclusivity ("Today only!" "Limited stock!")
- **Instagram**: Visual storytelling and brand building
- **Facebook**: Longer-form content, event promotion, and community discussions

### 4. Track what works

The Content Hub dashboard shows your publishing activity across all channels. Look for patterns:

- Which WhatsApp Status updates get the most replies?
- Which Instagram posts drive WhatsApp inquiries?
- Which Facebook posts get the most shares?

Use these insights to double down on what works and adjust what doesn't.

## Who is this for?

### Small businesses (UMKM) in Southeast Asia

If you sell through WhatsApp and Instagram — and millions of Indonesian businesses do — Content Publishing saves you hours every week. One dashboard instead of three apps. One content calendar instead of mental notes.

### Social media managers

Managing multiple client accounts? Each Gigaviz workspace is isolated, so you can manage multiple businesses without mixing up content. Switch between workspaces in seconds.

### Sales teams

Sales teams using WhatsApp as their primary channel can now publish Status updates showcasing products, then handle incoming inquiries from the same platform. No context-switching between a social media tool and your CRM.

### Marketing agencies

Agencies managing content across multiple platforms and clients get a structured workflow: create content, schedule, publish, and report — all from workspaces they already use for messaging and CRM.

## What's coming next

Content Publishing is live today with core functionality. Here's what's on the roadmap:

- **Analytics dashboard** — Detailed engagement metrics per channel and per post
- **Content calendar view** — Visual calendar showing scheduled content across all platforms
- **AI content suggestions** — Helper AI generates caption ideas, hashtag recommendations, and optimal posting times based on your audience
- **Bulk scheduling** — Upload a week's worth of content and schedule it all at once
- **Template library** — Save and reuse content templates for recurring promotions
