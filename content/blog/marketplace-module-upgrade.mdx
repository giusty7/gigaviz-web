## From Placeholder to Production

When we first shipped Gigaviz Marketplace, it was little more than a catalog page with a seller form. Items could be listed, but you couldn't buy them. There was no detail page, no purchase flow, no download mechanism, and no way for the ops team to moderate submissions.

This post documents how we systematically upgraded the Marketplace module across four phases — taking it from a basic scaffold to a fully functional digital product marketplace with token-based purchases, commission splits, review systems, file uploads, seller dashboards, and platform-level moderation.

## The Four-Phase Plan

We broke the work into four phases, each building on the previous:

| Phase | Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Make It Functional | Item detail page, purchase API, download API, entitlement gating, price pipeline fix, RLS + migration |
| **Phase 2** | Creator Experience | Item CRUD API, creator profile API, seller dashboard, shared TypeScript types, server-side library |
| **Phase 3** | User Experience | Search & filter UI, review system, file upload API, sub-navigation layout |
| **Phase 4** | Operations & Scale | Ops admin moderation, marketing page i18n, unit tests (69 assertions), blog + changelog |

## Phase 1: Making It Actually Work

The most critical gap was that users couldn't purchase items. We built:

### Item Detail Page

A full product view at `/marketplace/items/[itemSlug]` showing the item's thumbnail, title, description, tags, compatible platforms, reviews, and a sidebar with pricing, license details, and trust signals. The page detects three states: creator viewing their own item, a buyer who already purchased (showing download button with remaining count), and a potential buyer (showing the purchase button).

### Purchase API

The purchase flow uses the platform's token economy. When a buyer confirms a purchase:

1. Validate the item exists and is `approved`
2. Prevent self-purchase and duplicate purchases
3. Deduct tokens via an atomic database operation (row-locked)
4. Calculate 15/85 commission split
5. Insert purchase record with generated license key
6. Update item stats (best-effort RPC calls)

### Download API

Downloads are protected by license key verification. Each purchase has a download limit based on its license type. The API checks the license key, verifies ownership, increments the download count, and redirects to the file URL.

### Price Pipeline Fix

We discovered an inconsistency in the price conversion pipeline. The form converts user input to the smallest currency unit for storage, and displays by converting back. The currency conversion for IDR had an incorrect multiplier, which we fixed.

## Phase 2: Creator Experience

### Seller Dashboard

Creators get a dashboard at `/marketplace/dashboard` with four stat cards (total items, total sales, earnings, pending review) and a list of their items with status badges and action buttons (edit, view, delete/archive).

### Item CRUD API

Full REST API for marketplace items:
- `GET /api/marketplace/items/[itemId]` — single item
- `PATCH /api/marketplace/items/[itemId]` — update (creator-only, re-submits for review)
- `DELETE /api/marketplace/items/[itemId]` — archives if has purchases, hard deletes otherwise

### Server Library

We extracted all database queries into a dedicated server-only module with reusable functions for fetching items, managing seller data, calculating commissions, and handling moderation. This keeps route handlers thin and logic reusable.

## Phase 3: User Experience

### Search & Filter

A client component with real-time search, category filter pills, a free-only toggle, and sort options (newest, popular, price low/high, top-rated). Filters are reflected in URL search params for shareability.

### Review System

Buyers can leave 1–5 star reviews with text. The API enforces one review per purchase and automatically recalculates the item's average rating via an RPC. Creators can respond to reviews.

### File Upload

A two-step upload flow using Supabase Storage:
1. `POST` generates a signed upload URL for the `marketplace-files` bucket
2. `PATCH` confirms the upload and updates the item's `download_url`

## Phase 4: Operations & Scale

### Ops Moderation

Platform admins get a dedicated moderation page with:
- Stats cards (total items, pending review, approved, platform revenue)
- Status tabs with counts (pending, approved, rejected, draft, archived)
- Approve/reject actions with confirmation dialogs and rejection reason input
- Pagination for large catalogs

The moderation API is protected by platform admin authorization and all actions are logged for audit trails.

### Marketing Page i18n

We extracted all 50+ hardcoded English strings from the marketing page into the `productMarketplace` i18n namespace with full Indonesian translations. The page now uses `getTranslations("productMarketplace")` and renders locale-aware content.

### Testing

69 unit tests covering:
- TypeScript constants (commission rates, download limits)
- Commission calculation edge cases ($0.01 to $999.99)
- Price pipeline (cents conversion, IDR conversion)
- Status transition validation
- Zod schema validation for all API routes (purchase, review, item update, moderation, creator profile)
- i18n key completeness (both locales, all sections)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Token-Based Purchases?

The platform already has a mature token economy with wallets, ledger, and rate limiting. Using an atomic token deduction for marketplace purchases means:
- No external payment gateway dependency (Stripe/Xendit planned later)
- Atomic deduction with row-level locking
- Built-in budget guards and workspace scoping
- Consistent with existing billing infrastructure

### Why 15/85 Commission Split?

Industry standard for digital marketplaces ranges from 10–30%. We chose 15% as a balance between platform sustainability and creator incentive. The split is defined as a configurable constant for easy adjustment.

### Why Server-Only Library?

Extracting queries into a dedicated server-only module ensures:
- No accidental client-side data fetching
- Consistent workspace scoping across all consumers
- Single source of truth for business logic
- Easier testing and maintenance

## What's Next

The Marketplace module is now functionally complete. Remaining improvements:
- Payment gateway integration (Stripe/Xendit) for real money transactions
- Bundle support (multiple items in one package)
- Featured items and promotional placements
- Creator verification badges
- Analytics dashboard for creators (views, conversion rates)

*With 19 tasks across 4 phases — 24 new files, 69 tests, 150+ i18n keys — Gigaviz Marketplace is now a fully operational digital product marketplace.*
