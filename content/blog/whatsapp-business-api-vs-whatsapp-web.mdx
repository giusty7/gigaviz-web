# WhatsApp Business API vs WhatsApp Web: Which One Should Your Business Use?

If you're running a business that communicates with customers via WhatsApp, you've probably started with WhatsApp Web or the WhatsApp Business App. It works—until it doesn't.

This guide breaks down the differences, helps you decide when to upgrade, and shows how platforms like Gigaviz Meta Hub make the Cloud API accessible without requiring a developer team.

## The three tiers of WhatsApp for business

### 1. WhatsApp Web / WhatsApp Business App (Free)

- **Best for**: Solo founders, micro-businesses, <50 conversations/day
- **Limitations**: One device (or limited multi-device), no automation, no API access, no template messaging, manual everything

### 2. WhatsApp Business Platform — Cloud API (Official)

- **Best for**: Growing teams, customer support operations, marketing campaigns
- **Benefits**: Multi-agent inbox, message templates, delivery tracking, webhook events, automation, CRM integration
- **Cost**: Free to access (Meta hosted), conversation-based pricing for messages

### 3. WhatsApp Business Platform — On-Premises API (Legacy)

- **Best for**: Large enterprises with strict data residency requirements
- **Status**: Being phased out by Meta in favor of Cloud API

## Feature comparison

| Feature | WhatsApp Web | Cloud API (via Gigaviz) |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Multi-agent support | ❌ | ✅ Unlimited agents |
| Message templates | ❌ | ✅ Full template management |
| Delivery receipts | Basic | ✅ Granular (sent/delivered/read/failed) |
| Automation | ❌ | ✅ Auto-reply, workflows |
| CRM integration | ❌ | ✅ Contact management, tags, notes |
| Analytics | ❌ | ✅ Response time, volume, agent performance |
| Compliance | ❌ | ✅ Audit logs, policy enforcement |
| Broadcast/Campaign | ❌ | ✅ Template-based campaigns |
| AI-powered replies | ❌ | ✅ With Gigaviz Helper |
| Webhook events | ❌ | ✅ Real-time status updates |

## When should you upgrade to Cloud API?

You should consider upgrading when:

1. **Your team has more than 2 agents** handling WhatsApp conversations
2. **You need message templates** for notifications, confirmations, or reminders
3. **Response time matters** and you want SLA tracking
4. **Compliance is required** (healthcare, finance, government)
5. **You want automation** for repetitive replies
6. **You're losing track of conversations** without a proper inbox

## The hidden costs of staying on WhatsApp Web

Teams that delay upgrading often face:

- **Lost messages**: When two agents try to respond from the same phone
- **No audit trail**: "Who said what to the customer?" becomes unanswerable
- **Manual labor**: Copy-pasting the same reply hundreds of times
- **No analytics**: You can't improve what you can't measure
- **Compliance risk**: No way to enforce messaging policies or log interactions

## How Gigaviz Meta Hub makes Cloud API accessible

The WhatsApp Cloud API is powerful but technical. You need to:

1. Create a Meta Business Account
2. Set up a WhatsApp Business Platform account
3. Register a phone number
4. Configure webhooks
5. Build template management
6. Handle delivery status tracking
7. Build a multi-agent inbox

Gigaviz Meta Hub handles all of this. You connect your WhatsApp Business Platform account, and Meta Hub provides:

- **Template Manager**: Create, submit, and track template approvals
- **Unified Inbox**: Multi-agent inbox with real-time message delivery
- **Contact Management**: Organized contacts with tags, notes, and conversation history
- **Webhook Processing**: Automatic delivery status tracking and event logging
- **AI Integration**: Gigaviz Helper suggests replies based on your knowledge base

## Getting started: From WhatsApp Web to Cloud API

The transition takes about 30 minutes:

1. **Create your Gigaviz account** at [gigaviz.com/get-started](/get-started)
2. **Set up your workspace** and invite your team
3. **Connect your WhatsApp Business Platform** account via Meta Hub
4. **Import your contacts** or start fresh
5. **Create your first template** for common messages
6. **Start receiving messages** in your unified inbox

## Common questions

**Will I lose my existing chats?**
No. Cloud API uses a separate flow. Your WhatsApp Web chats remain intact. However, customers will now interact through the API-connected number.

**Can I use both at the same time?**
You can use WhatsApp Web for personal messaging and Cloud API for business messaging on a different number.

**What happens if I exceed my message limits?**
WhatsApp uses a tier-based system. As you send quality messages, your limits automatically increase. Gigaviz helps you monitor your current tier and usage.

**Is Cloud API available in my country?**
Cloud API is available in most countries where WhatsApp operates. Check [Meta's documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/overview) for region-specific details.
