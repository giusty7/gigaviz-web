# Why Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture Matters for Business Messaging

When businesses send thousands of WhatsApp messages a day, every architectural decision becomes a trust decision. A leaked contact list, a miscounted invoice, or a misrouted message can end a relationship in seconds.

At Gigaviz, we chose multi-tenant architecture from day one—not because it's trendy, but because it solves real problems that single-tenant setups simply can't.

## The problem: shared infrastructure, separate concerns

Most teams start with a simple setup: one database, one login, one admin panel. It works until your second client joins and asks "can you guarantee my data is never visible to anyone else?"

That question is the dividing line between a prototype and a platform.

## How Gigaviz handles workspace isolation

Every query in Gigaviz is scoped by `workspace_id`. This isn't a convention—it's enforced at three layers:

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)

Every user-facing table has PostgreSQL RLS policies that check workspace membership before returning data. Even if application code has a bug, the database itself blocks unauthorized access.

### 2. App Context Resolution

Server components call a context resolution function to resolve the authenticated user, their workspace, their role, and their entitlements—before any business logic runs. There's no way to skip this step.

### 3. Entitlement Gating

Features are gated by entitlements (mapped to specific product modules), which combine plan subscriptions with admin-granted overrides. You can’t access what you haven’t been granted.

## Why this matters for WhatsApp operations

WhatsApp Business Platform requires strict compliance. Messages must go through approved templates, contacts must be managed carefully, and delivery logs must be auditable.

Multi-tenant isolation means:

- **Your templates are yours.** No cross-workspace template leakage.
- **Your contacts stay private.** RLS ensures contact data never crosses workspace boundaries.
- **Your audit trail is clean.** Every webhook, delivery status, and agent action is logged per workspace.
- **Your token usage is tracked.** AI and messaging tokens are deducted per workspace with full ledger history.

## The cost of getting this wrong

We've seen platforms where:

- Agent A from Company X accidentally sees Company Y's inbox
- A bulk message job sends to contacts from the wrong workspace
- An admin panel exposes aggregate data without proper scoping

These aren't hypothetical—they're the exact failure modes that multi-tenant architecture prevents.

## What we sacrificed for safety

Multi-tenant architecture adds complexity. Every database query needs an extra filter. Every API route needs context resolution. Every migration needs RLS policies.

But we'd rather ship slower and ship safe than move fast and leak data.

## For developers building similar systems

If you're building a multi-tenant SaaS platform, here's our advice:

1. **Start with RLS from day one.** Retrofitting it is painful.
2. **Never trust client input for workspace_id.** Always resolve it server-side.
3. **Use service role sparingly.** When you bypass RLS, you bypass safety.
4. **Test with multiple workspaces.** A single-workspace test suite misses cross-tenant bugs.
5. **Log everything per workspace.** Audit trails are useless without proper scoping.

## What's next

We're expanding our workspace isolation to support regional data residency (GDPR compliance), workspace-level encryption at rest, and cross-workspace collaboration features that maintain isolation boundaries.

Gigaviz Platform (Core OS) is the foundation that makes all of this possible. Every module—Meta Hub, Helper, Studio, and beyond—inherits these safety guarantees automatically.
