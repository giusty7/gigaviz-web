We've upgraded the inbox experience with real-time message status tracking and better thread management.

## What's improved

- **Real-time delivery status**: See sent ✓, delivered ✓✓, and read ✓✓ indicators on every outbound message
- **Thread assignment**: Assign conversations to specific agents with one click
- **SLA indicators**: Visual indicators show when conversations are approaching or breaching SLA targets
- **Message timeline**: Full message lifecycle from queued → sent → delivered → read → failed

## Technical details

- WebSocket-based real-time updates (no polling required)
- Automatic status synchronization from Meta webhook events
- SLA calculation based on configurable workspace-level thresholds
- Thread state machine: open → assigned → waiting → resolved → closed
