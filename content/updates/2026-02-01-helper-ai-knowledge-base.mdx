Gigaviz Helper has entered beta with a powerful knowledge base and AI reply suggestions.

## What's new

- **Knowledge Base**: Upload documents, web pages, and FAQs to teach the AI about your business
- **Vector search**: Semantic search powered by pgvector finds relevant answers even when wording differs
- **Smart reply suggestions**: AI-generated reply suggestions appear automatically in inbox conversations
- **One-click insert**: Accept, edit, or reject AI suggestions before sending to customers
- **Workspace isolation**: Each workspace's knowledge base is completely separate — no data leakage

## How it works

1. Upload your documents in Helper → Knowledge Base
2. Run the indexing pipeline (automatic or manual)
3. Open any inbox conversation
4. Helper suggests replies based on the customer's message + your knowledge base
5. Accept, edit, or write your own reply

## Coming soon

- Workflow automation (trigger → condition → action)
- CRM insights dashboard
- Multi-language knowledge base support
