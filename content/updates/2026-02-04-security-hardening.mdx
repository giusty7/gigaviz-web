We've completed a comprehensive security hardening pass across the entire platform.

## Security improvements

- **Auth guards on all ops routes**: Every platform admin route now uses `requirePlatformAdmin()` — no exceptions
- **Ops layout guard**: Additional safety net at the layout level prevents unauthorized access
- **Structured JSON logging**: All server logs now use structured format with correlation IDs and PII scrubbing
- **Slack/Discord alerting**: Real-time alerts for health incidents, impersonation events, and account suspensions

## Infrastructure changes

- **Rate limiting**: Ops console now rate-limited at 30 requests/60 seconds via Upstash Redis
- **Audit trail**: All admin mutations logged with before/after snapshots in `owner_audit_log`
- **SQL Runner expansion**: Whitelisted tables expanded from 12 → 33 for better debugging access
- **Error boundaries**: `loading.tsx` + `error.tsx` added to all route groups and sub-routes

## What this means for customers

- Faster incident detection and response
- Stronger protection against unauthorized platform access
- Better audit trail for compliance requirements
- Zero impact on application performance
