Contact management has graduated from basic to CRM-grade with tags, notes, and full conversation history.

## What's new

- **Contact tags**: Organize contacts with custom tags (VIP, lead, churned, etc.)
- **Internal notes**: Add private notes to contacts visible only to your team
- **Conversation history**: View all past threads with a contact in one timeline
- **Phone normalization**: Automatic phone number formatting ensures no duplicate contacts
- **Bulk import**: Import contacts from CSV with automatic deduplication

## CRM features

- **Contact detail panel**: Full profile view with tags, notes, and conversation summary
- **Search and filter**: Find contacts by name, phone, tags, or last activity
- **Workspace-scoped**: Each workspace has its own contact database — fully isolated
- **Thread linking**: Every conversation thread is linked to a contact record

## Technical details

- Contacts stored in `wa_contacts` table with RLS policies
- Phone numbers normalized to E.164 format (`+` prefix, digits only)
- Full-text search with PostgreSQL `tsvector` indexing
- Bulk operations support with workspace-scoped transactions
