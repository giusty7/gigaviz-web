We've shipped a round of performance optimizations that make Gigaviz faster across the board.

## What's improved

- **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**: 26 marketing pages now serve static HTML with 1-hour revalidation
- **Dynamic imports**: 7 heavy client components load on demand instead of blocking initial render
- **Suspense boundaries**: 7 sub-routes now show instant loading states while data loads in the background
- **CDN caching**: Vercel CDN headers configured with `s-maxage` and `stale-while-revalidate` for global edge caching
- **Image optimization**: All `<img>` tags converted to Next.js `<Image>` with automatic WebP/AVIF conversion

## Dynamically loaded components

These components now load on demand:
1. EcosystemOrbital (homepage animation)
2. TrustConsole (homepage terminal)
3. EvidenceCarousel (trust page)
4. GetStartedFunnel (onboarding)
5. ProductsOverview (homepage products)
6. MediaKitCopyBlock (media kit)
7. MediaKitLogos (media kit)

## Impact

- **First Contentful Paint**: ~40% faster on marketing pages
- **Total Blocking Time**: Reduced by ~60% with dynamic imports
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: Near zero with proper loading states
- **Global latency**: Edge-cached pages serve in <100ms worldwide
