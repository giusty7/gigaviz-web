Gigaviz now supports **dual payment gateways** — Midtrans for local Indonesian payments and Xendit for international multi-currency checkout.

## What's new

- **Midtrans (IDR)**: Snap popup checkout with bank transfer (BCA, BNI, BRI, Mandiri), e-wallets (GoPay, ShopeePay, DANA, OVO), QRIS, and convenience stores (Alfamart, Indomaret).
- **Xendit (Multi-Currency)**: Invoice-based hosted checkout supporting IDR, USD, and SGD. International cards (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, JCB), plus all Indonesian local payment methods.
- **Multi-currency pricing**: All subscription plans and token packages have IDR, USD, and SGD pricing with yearly discounts.
- **Webhook processing**: Both gateways process payment notifications automatically — tokens are credited and subscriptions activated instantly.
