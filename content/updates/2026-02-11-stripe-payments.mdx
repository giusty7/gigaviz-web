Token top-ups now support credit card payments via Stripe — alongside the existing manual transfer option.

## What's new

- **Pay with Card**: One-click Stripe Checkout for instant token top-ups. Select a package, click "Pay with Card", complete payment on Stripe's secure checkout page, and tokens are credited automatically.
- **Dual payment mode**: Every token package now shows two buttons — "Pay with Card" (Stripe) and "Manual / Transfer" (bank transfer). Choose whichever suits your workflow.
- **Feature flag**: Stripe payments are controlled via `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_ENABLED` — disable card payments anytime without code changes.
- **Webhook processing**: Stripe webhooks automatically process `checkout.session.completed` events and credit tokens to your workspace.

## How it works

1. Select a token package (Basic, Pro, or Enterprise)
2. Click **Pay with Card** to open Stripe Checkout
3. Complete payment with credit card, debit card, or supported local methods
4. Tokens are credited to your workspace automatically
5. Transaction appears in your Token Ledger immediately

## Manual transfer still available

For businesses that prefer bank transfers or local payment methods, the manual flow remains fully functional:

1. Click **Manual / Transfer**
2. Complete your bank transfer
3. Mark the top-up as paid from the billing page
4. Admin activates the top-up after verification
