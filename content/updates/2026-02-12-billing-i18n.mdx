The billing dashboard is now fully internationalized with 50+ translated strings across Indonesian and English.

## What's improved

- **Royal Treasury header**: Plan name, billing period, seat limits, and status badges adapt to your selected language
- **Token Wallet**: Balance display, top-up buttons, payment confirmation toasts — all translated
- **Payment flows**: "Pay with Card", "Manual / Transfer", processing states, and error messages in your language
- **Feature Access section**: Feature labels, availability badges ("Available" / "Locked"), and plan alerts
- **Toast notifications**: All success and error messages (top-up created, checkout failed, confirmation, etc.)

## Coverage
