We've crossed a major quality milestone: 502 automated tests across 38 test files, with statement coverage jumping from 4.97% to 10.9%.

## What's improved

- **502 tests passing**: Up from 349 — a 44% increase in test coverage
- **38 test files**: 5 new test suites covering critical business logic
- **10.9% statement coverage**: Doubled from 4.97%, covering 580+ statements
- **All CI checks green**: Lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, and E2E — all passing

## New test suites

Five high-impact test suites were added targeting the most critical modules:

- **Token system** (28 tests): Wallet operations, ledger management, settings, usage tracking, overview calculations, token consumption, and top-up request flows
- **Platform admin** (15 tests): Email allowlist validation, admin lookup, authentication guards, and role verification
- **Entitlements engine** (11 tests): Plan resolution, override merging, expiry handling, legacy fallback paths, and feature gating
- **Billing summary** (9 tests): Subscription state mapping, usage metric calculations, period formatting, and plan resolution
- **Workspace resolution** (6 tests): UUID passthrough, slug-to-UUID lookup, and edge case handling

## What this means for customers

- Fewer bugs reaching production — critical payment and billing flows are now tested
- Faster feature delivery — tests catch regressions before they ship
- Stronger entitlement enforcement — feature gating logic is independently verified
- Better token economy — wallet and ledger operations are validated end-to-end

## Testing infrastructure

- **Vitest 4.0**: Fast, TypeScript-native test runner with V8 coverage
- **Testing Library + jsdom**: Component testing with React Testing Library
- **Playwright**: End-to-end browser tests (24 E2E tests across 2 spec files)
- **CI/CD**: All tests run on every push via GitHub Actions
