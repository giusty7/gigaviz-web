We've completed a comprehensive audit and cleanup of the internal ops console — 18 files improved across 26 pages.

## What changed

### Authentication standardization
- **7 pages** now properly pass `actorEmail` and `actorRole` to OpsShell — the header badge correctly shows the logged-in admin's email instead of a generic "platform-admin" label
- **6 pages** replaced `throw new Error("Unauthorized")` with clean `redirect("/")` — no more ugly error boundaries on auth failures
- **2 pages** fixed inconsistent redirect targets (`/login` → `/`) to match the standard pattern
- Removed redundant `assertOpsEnabled()` calls — the layout guard already handles this

### Boundary gaps filled
- Added missing `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` for the workspace detail route (`/ops/workspaces/[id]`)
- All 26 ops pages now have complete loading and error states

### UI consistency
- Fixed palette mismatch on the operations page: `zinc-*` → `slate-*` to match the rest of the console
- Removed stale "IMPERIUM INTERNAL OPS" branding from the tickets page
- Fixed double redirect: `/owner` now goes directly to `/ops` instead of bouncing through `/ops/platform-admin`

## Impact

These changes improve security posture (no more thrown errors leaking context), visual consistency, and loading performance for the internal ops console.
