We're launching **Gigaviz Studio** — a creative suite built into the Gigaviz platform with three specialized modules.

## What shipped

### Studio Hub
- Module catalog with Office, Graph, and Tracks cards
- Real-time stats from your workspace data (document count, chart count, workflow count)
- Entitlement-gated access per module

### Office — AI Document Automation
- **Document list** with status, type, and timestamps
- **Create new document** flow with title, type selector (Excel, Word, PDF), and AI description
- **Document detail** view with metadata, content preview, and action buttons
- Full CRUD API with error handling wrapper

### Graph — Data Visualization
- **Chart listing** with type indicators (bar, line, pie, area, scatter) and stats
- **Dashboard listing** with public/private badges and update timestamps
- Charts and dashboards API with entitlement checks

### Tracks — Workflow Automation
- **Workflow listing** with status indicators (active, paused, completed, failed)
- **Execution run history** with duration, timestamps, and status tracking
- Workflows API with entitlement checks

## Technical improvements

- **All pages** use RLS-respecting database clients
- **All API routes** wrapped with error handling middleware for correlation IDs, structured logging, and error tracking
- **Entitlement checks** on every API route for each module
- **Loading skeletons** for every sub-route with module-themed accent colors (cyan, purple, teal)
- **Error boundaries** on every sub-route using `SubRouteError` component
- **Broken links eliminated** — unbuilt features show disabled buttons with "coming soon" tooltips
- **Dynamic Tailwind classes** replaced with static color maps for reliable purging

## New files

- 4 API routes: office documents (list + CRUD), graph charts, tracks workflows
- 10 loading/error boundary files across all sub-routes
- Studio hub page, layout, and sidebar navigation
- 8 sub-module pages: Office (list, new, detail), Graph (charts, dashboards), Tracks (workflows, runs)

## What's next

- Visual builders for charts, dashboards, and workflows
- Office template designer
- Cross-module automation (Tracks → Office → Graph)
