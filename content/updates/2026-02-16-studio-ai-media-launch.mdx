## Database migration

New database migration adds three tables for images, videos, and music — each with workspace scoping, style/prompt fields, media metadata, and file URL storage.

All tables have: RLS enabled, performance indexes, and workspace membership access policies.

## UI improvements

- **Sidebar updated**: All three items changed from "SOON" (disabled div) to "BETA" (clickable Link)
- **Hub page updated**: Removed "Coming Soon" teaser, module stats now include images/videos/music counts
- **next/image optimization**: All thumbnails use Next.js `<Image>` component instead of raw `<img>`
- **18 loading/error files**: Skeleton loading states and error boundaries for all 9 route segments

## i18n (English + Indonesian)

Added **45+ translation keys** across both locale files:
- `studio.images.*` — title, description, stats, empty states, locked states
- `studio.videos.*` — title, description, stats, empty states, locked states
- `studio.music.*` — title, description, stats, empty states, locked states

## Quality checks

- ✅ `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
- ✅ `npm run typecheck` — clean (no new errors)
- ✅ `npm run build` — compiled successfully in 43s
