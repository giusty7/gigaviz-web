The Studio AI engine is now **fully wired** — all 6 content types can be generated from a single prompt, with real visualization on detail pages.

## What shipped

### 🧠 Unified Generation API
- **Single endpoint** handles document, image, chart, video, music, and dashboard generation
- **Zod discriminated union** validates 6 request types with type-safe fields
- **Token deduction** before AI calls — 402 on insufficient balance
- **Status transitions**: draft → generating → completed (or failed with retry)
- **Entitlement checks** per module (office, graph, tracks)

### 🤖 AI Models
- **GPT-4o-mini** for structured content: documents (sections + summary), charts (type + data + config), video storyboards (scenes + script + music), music compositions (structure + instruments + waveform), dashboard layouts (stat/chart/text/table widgets)
- **DALL-E 3** for image generation: 10 style presets mapped to DALL-E sizes, revised prompt returned

### 📊 Real Visualization Components
- **ChartRenderer** — recharts-based rendering for bar, line, pie, area, radar, scatter with dark theme
- **DashboardRenderer** — responsive widget grid (stat cards, chart widgets, text, tables)
- **WaveformVisualizer** — canvas-based audio waveform with play/pause animation and gradient bars
- **VideoStoryboard** — timeline visualization, scene cards, narration script, music suggestion
- **GenerateButton** — reusable AI trigger with loading state, error handling, token gating

### ⚡ Auto-Trigger on Creation
- All 6 "new" pages now fire-and-forget AI generation when a prompt is provided
- User navigates to detail page immediately — generation happens in background
- Chart and dashboard new pages now include AI prompt fields

### 📋 Template Cloning
- **Template clone API** creates a new document from any template
- Templates page "Use Template" button calls clone API directly (no more redirect to /new)
- Usage counter incremented atomically

## Technical Details
- 8 new files, ~2,800 lines of code
- 28 files changed total (new components + updated pages + API routes + i18n)
- All checks pass: typecheck ✅ lint ✅ build ✅ (245 pages)
- i18n: 12 new translation keys (EN + ID) for generation UI
