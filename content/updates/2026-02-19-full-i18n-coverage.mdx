Every client component in Gigaviz is now fully internationalized. Sprint 13 and 14 wired the final 63 components — from dashboard widgets and notification panels to the entire Ops Console and marketing pages.

## What's new

- **63 client components wired**: All remaining hardcoded English strings replaced with `useTranslations()` hooks
- **500+ new translation keys**: Across 14 new i18n namespaces in both English and Indonesian
- **Ops Console i18n**: God Console, health dashboard, customer search, entitlements manager, knowledge base, tickets, analytics, dev tools, and all operations pages — fully bilingual
- **Marketing pages i18n**: Ecosystem overview, trust console, media kit, verification badge, evidence section, and product grid
- **Dashboard widgets**: All 8 widgets (plan summary, revenue, recent activity, quick actions, team, tokens, meta hub, and overview) now translated
- **Notification system**: 30+ notification type labels, timestamps, actions, and empty states
- **Links Manager**: Full i18n across link cards, forms, sharing modals, analytics panels, and appearance settings
- **Duplicate JSON key fix**: Critical bug fixed where `metaHubUI` namespace appeared twice in both locale files, causing key collisions

## Coverage by module

| Module | Components wired | Keys added |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Dashboard Widgets | 8 | 31 |
| Notifications | 1 | 38 |
| Links Manager | 5 | 70+ |
| Ops Console | 20 | 200+ |
| Marketing | 10 | 38 |
| Auth & Layout | 3 | 5 |
| Settings & Modules | 4 | 35 |
| Billing & Contacts | 3 | 28 |

## New i18n namespaces

14 new top-level translation namespaces added:

`moduleGridUI` · `settingsUI` · `notificationsUI` · `dashboardWidgetsUI` · `setPasswordUI` · `contactFormUI` · `inviteUI` · `usageUI` · `featureGateUI` · `linksUI` · `authLayoutUI` · `opsUI` · `marketingUI` · `previewBannerUI`

## Quality assurance

- **1,248 tests passing**: All 64 test files green — zero regressions
- **0 TypeScript errors**: Clean `tsc --noEmit`
- **0 lint errors**: Clean ESLint
- **Clean build**: `next build` succeeds
- **217 files changed**: +15,146 / −3,758 lines across one commit

## Technical details

- All client components use `useTranslations("namespace")` from `next-intl`
- Ops Console uses deeply nested dot-path keys (`opsUI.godConsole.title`, `opsUI.devTools.sql.title`, etc.)
- Feature gate component refactored to satisfy React Rules of Hooks (hook call moved before early returns)
- Custom JSON parser built to deep-merge duplicate keys at every nesting level — fixed 4 overlapping sub-keys in `metaHubUI`
- Both `messages/en.json` and `messages/id.json` updated and validated with 0 duplicate keys
