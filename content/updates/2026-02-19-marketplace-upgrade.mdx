Gigaviz Marketplace has been upgraded from a basic catalog page to a fully functional digital product marketplace. Here's everything that shipped.

## What's New

### Phase 1 — Core Purchase Flow
- **Item detail page** — full product view with pricing sidebar, license details, trust signals
- **Purchase API** — token-based purchases with 15/85 commission split, duplicate prevention
- **Download API** — license key verification, download limits per license type
- **Entitlement gating** — sell and purchases pages now require `marketplace` entitlement
- **Price pipeline fix** — Currency conversion corrected for proper smallest-unit handling
- **Migration** — new RLS policies for purchases, 3 helper RPCs, performance indexes

### Phase 2 — Creator Experience
- **Item CRUD API** — create, update, delete marketplace items (auto re-submit for review)
- **Creator profile API** — manage display name, bio, website, payout email
- **Seller dashboard** — stats cards (items, sales, earnings, pending), item management
- **Shared types** — `types/marketplace.ts` with all interfaces, commission constants, download limits
- **Server library** — `lib/marketplace/index.ts` with 10+ reusable functions

### Phase 3 — User Experience
- **Search & filter** — real-time search, category pills, free-only toggle, sort options
- **Review system** — 1–5 star ratings, one per purchase, auto-recalculates item rating
- **File upload** — Supabase Storage integration with signed URLs
- **Sub-navigation** — Browse, Sell, Purchases, Dashboard tabs

### Phase 4 — Operations & Scale
- **Ops moderation** — Admin moderation page with approve/reject actions, status tabs, revenue stats
- **Marketing i18n** — 50+ strings extracted to `productMarketplace` namespace (en + id)
- **69 unit tests** — types, commission, price pipeline, Zod schemas, i18n completeness
- **Blog post** — engineering story documenting the full upgrade
