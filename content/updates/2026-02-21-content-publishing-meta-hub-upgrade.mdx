A major upgrade bringing social media content publishing to Meta Hub, along with navigation improvements, bug fixes, and visual enhancements across the platform.

## What shipped

### 📱 Content Publishing Module (New)

Publish and manage content across your social media channels — all from one hub.

- **Content Hub** — Central dashboard showing publishing activity across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook with quick-access cards and real-time stats
- **WhatsApp Status** — Create and schedule WhatsApp Status updates with text, images, and links. Preview how they'll appear to your contacts before publishing
- **Instagram Content** — Manage Instagram posts, stories, and reels. Upload media, write captions, add hashtags, and schedule publication times
- **Facebook Content** — Create Facebook Page posts with rich media, links, and call-to-action buttons. Schedule or publish immediately

All content pages are fully translated in English and Indonesian with 110+ new translation keys.

### 🧭 Meta Hub Navigation Reorganization

The Meta Hub sidebar has been reorganized from a flat list into 5 logical sections for better discoverability:

| Section | Features |
|---------|----------|
| **Setup** | Connections, Webhooks |
| **Messaging** | Templates, Composer, Scheduler, Inbox |
| **Content** | Content Hub, WhatsApp Status, Instagram, Facebook |
| **Growth** | Contacts, Automation, Flows |
| **Analytics** | Delivery Reports, Performance |

Each section is collapsible with visual indicators, making it easier to find features as the module grows.

### 🎨 Marketplace Premium Redesign

The Marketplace page has been redesigned with a premium dark theme featuring:
- Gradient backgrounds with glass-morphism cards
- Animated hover effects and smooth transitions
- Better visual hierarchy for featured items and categories
- Improved mobile responsiveness

### 🔧 Studio AI Bug Fixes

Fixed a critical bug where AI generation failed silently on all 6 Studio content types. The entity identifier field was not being passed correctly during creation, causing generation requests to fail. All 6 "new" pages (documents, images, charts, videos, music, dashboards) have been corrected.

### 🌐 89 New Translation Keys

Added missing translations across multiple modules:

| Module | Keys Added |
|--------|-----------|
| Helper AI | 45 keys — chat interface, knowledge base, CRM insights, workflow labels |
| Platform | 25 keys — workspace settings, team management, audit log labels |
| Meta Hub | 19 keys — template status badges, connection labels, delivery indicators |
